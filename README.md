# Frontend Mentor - REST Countries API with color theme switcher

![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./showcase-images/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! 👋

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as [React](https://reactjs.org) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org). You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage (Done ✔️)
- Search for a country using an `input` field (Done ✔️)
- Filter countries by region (Done ✔️)
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page (Done ✔️)
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page (Done ✔️)
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode (Done ✔️)

**⚠️ NOTE ⚠️: Sometimes the REST Countries API can go down. We've added a `data.json` file with all the country data if you prefer to use that instead. However, please be aware that the data in the JSON file might not be up-to-date.**
